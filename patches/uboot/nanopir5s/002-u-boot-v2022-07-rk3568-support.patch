-Devicetree compiler
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Boards that use `CONFIG_OF_CONTROL` (i.e. almost all of them) need the
-devicetree compiler (dtc). Those with `CONFIG_PYLIBFDT` need pylibfdt, a Python
-library for accessing devicetree data. Suitable versions of these are included
-in the U-Boot tree in `scripts/dtc` and built automatically as needed.
-
-To use the system versions of these, use the DTC parameter, for example
-
-.. code-block:: bash
-
-    DTC=/usr/bin/dtc make
-
-In this case, dtc and pylibfdt are not built. The build checks that the version
-of dtc is new enough. It also makes sure that pylibfdt is present, if needed
-(see `scripts_dtc` in the Makefile).
-
-Note that the :doc:`tools` are always built with the included version of libfdt
-so it is not possible to build U-Boot tools with a system libfdt, at present.
