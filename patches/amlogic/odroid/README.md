### When building kernels for Odroids you have two options: [tobetter](https://github.com/tobetter/linux) or [mainline](https://www.kernel.org/)

**Examples:**

tobetter
```sh
Branch: 5.14.y
```

mainline
```sh
Branch: 5.14.14
```

The current patch set used for mainline is not exactly the same one used in the tobetter repo and may or may not be behind on updates.
