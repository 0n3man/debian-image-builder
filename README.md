## Usage

#### /boot/rename_to_credentials.txt
```sh
Rename file to credentials.txt and input your wifi information.

SSID=" "			# Service set identifier
PASSKEY=" "			# Wifi password
COUNTRYCODE=" "			# Your country code

# set static ip
MANUAL=n			# Set to y to enable a static ip
IPADDR=" "			# Static ip address
NETMASK=" "			# Your Netmask
GATEWAY=" "			# Your Gateway
NAMESERVERS=" "			# Your preferred dns

For headless use: ssh user@ipaddress

Note:
You can also mount the ROOTFS partition and edit the following
files, whilst leaving rename_to_credentials.txt untouched.

/etc/opt/interfaces.manual
/etc/opt/wpa_supplicant.manual
```

#### Write to eMMC
```sh
Supported: Le Potato, Odroid C4/N2/N2+, NanoPi NEO Plus2 and NanoPC-T4
1. Attach eMMC module       # In some cases the module may need to be attached after boot
2. Boot from sdcard
3. Execute: sudo write2mmc
```
#### Deb EEPROM ([usb_storage.quirks](https://github.com/pyavitz/rpi-img-builder/issues/17))

```sh
Raspberry Pi 4B EEPROM Helper Script
Usage: deb-eeprom -h

   -U       Upgrade eeprom package
   -w       Transfer to USB	# Supported: EXT4, BTRFS and F2FS
   -u       Update script

Note:
Upon install please run 'deb-eeprom -u' before using this script.
```
#### Simple wifi helper
```sh
swh -h

   -s       Scan for SSID's
   -u       Bring up interface
   -d       Bring down interface
   -r       Restart interface
   -W       Edit wpa supplicant
   -I       Edit interfaces
```
#### CPU frequency scaling
```sh
governor -h

   -c       Conservative
   -o       Ondemand
   -p       Performance
   -s       Schedutil

   -r       Run
   -u       Update
   
A systemd service runs 'governor -r' during boot.
```
#### Overclocking (NanoPC-T4 & Odroid N2/+)
By default the NanoPC-T4 and Odroid N2/+ run slightly under clocked as a safety precaution. If you decide to overclock the board, make sure you are using passive and active cooling.
```sh
echo "overclock=1" | sudo tee /etc/opt/overclock.txt
sudo service tweaks restart
```
#### Odroid N2 Fan Control

```sh
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyavitz/scripts/master/fan-ctrl -P /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fan-ctrl

```sh
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/odroid-fan-ctrl.service <<EOF
